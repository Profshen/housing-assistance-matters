Other federal rental assistance, such as 521 rental assistance, funded by the US Department of Agriculture, is not included in the calculations.  It is important to note that because HUD has provided the data from its administrative systems, we consider it more complete compared to data tabulations from the American Housing Survey that may be used to estimate federal rental assistance.</div>

		<div class = "footer text"><p>The figures in this analysis represent a best estimate of the affordable rental housing gap and federal assistance for extremely low-income (ELI) renter households at the county level in the United States. The data analyzed come from multiple sources – the American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) from the Census (via the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series from the Minnesota Population Center), data provided by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from the Public and Indian Housing Information Center(PIC) and Tenant Rental Assistance Certification System (TRACs), the HUD Section 8 Income Limits, and ACS pre-tabulated data from the Census.</p>
		<p>The data on HUD assisted housing represents a best estimate of the total number of HUD subsidized ELI households. We include only those programs for which we can obtain data from HUD, namely, Public Housing, Housing Choice Vouchers, Moderate Rehabilitation, and Section 8 New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation, and only those recipients who are not rent-burdened.  Because no data source identifies Section 521 units, funded through the US Department of Agriculture, at the county level, these units are not included in this analysis, providing an undercount of federal assistance to ELI renter households in rural counties.</p>
